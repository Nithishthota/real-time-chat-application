Description:



Implement a real-time chat application enabling authenticated users to join private or group conversations. Utilize WebSockets or Pub/Sub to deliver low-latency messaging with proper ordering and retries.

Include core features such as message history with search, presence and typing indicators, delivery/read receipts, and multimedia (files, images, videos). Secure the system with authentication and optional end-to-end encryption.

Enhance UX with push notifications, ability to edit/delete messages, and automatic reconnection. For advanced tasks, support moderation (e.g., roles, spam filtering) and integrate voice/video calls using WebRTC.
